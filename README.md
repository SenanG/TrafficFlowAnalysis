# TrafficFlowAnalysis
A simple project to detect how many cars pass through a typical intersection in Waterloo. Made for use for an Optimization class project.

Here's a breakdown of each file function:

aggregator.py - Measures time increments for count outputs
analyze.py - Displays CSV results with matplotlib
colors.py - List of colors for tracked objects
counter.py - Checks line crossing counts tracked objects
detector.py - Runs object recognition on image
tracker.py - Tracks objects
view_camera.py - main file

This project was inspired by Eric Yim on youtube
